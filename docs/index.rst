Flask-OGM: documentation
========================

Flask-OGM provides an interface between a flask application and the py2neo_ driver for the neo4j_ graph database. This allows you to use its OGM (Object Graph Model) interface, and to execute cypher queries using py2neo as a driver.

.. _py2neo: http://py2neo.org/v3/
.. _neo4j: https://neo4j.com/

Other features will be added shortly as time goes on to assist with developing Flask apps using py2neo.
